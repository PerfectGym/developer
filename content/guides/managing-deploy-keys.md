# Managing Deploy Keys

{:toc}

There are four ways to manage SSH keys on your servers when automating deployment scripts:

* SSH agent forwarding
* HTTPS with OAuth tokens
* Deploy keys
* Machine users

This guide will help you decide what strategy is best for you.

## SSH agent forwarding

In many cases, especially in the beginning of a project, SSH agent forwarding is the quickest and simplest method to use.  Agent forwarding uses the same SSH keys that your local development computer uses.

#### Pros

* You do not have to generate or keep track of any new keys.
* There is no key management; users have the same permissions on the server that they do locally.
* No keys are stored on the server, so in case the server is compromised, you don't need to hunt down and remove the compromised keys.

#### Cons

* Users **must** SSH in to deploy; automated deploy processes can't be used.
* SSH agent forwarding can be troublesome to run for Windows users.

#### Setup

1. Turn on agent forwarding locally. See [our guide on SSH agent forwarding][ssh-agent-forwarding] for more information.
2. Set your deploy scripts to use agent forwarding. For example, on a bash script, enabling agent forwarding would look something like this: `ssh -A serverA 'bash -s' < deploy.sh`

## HTTPS cloning with OAuth tokens

If you don't want to use SSH keys, you can use [HTTPS with OAuth tokens][git-automation].

#### Pros

* Anyone with access to the server can deploy the repository.
* Users don't have to change their local SSH settings.
* Multiple tokens (one for each user) are not needed; one token per server is enough.
* A token can be revoked at any time, turning it essentially into a one-use password.
* Generating new tokens can be easily scripted using [the OAuth API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/#create-a-new-authorization)

#### Cons

* You must make sure that you configure your token with the correct access scopes.
* Tokens are essentially passwords, and must be protected the same way.

#### Setup

See [our guide on Git automation with tokens][git-automation].

## Deploy keys

A deploy key is an SSH key that is stored on your server and grants access to a single GitHub repository.  This key is attached directly to the repository instead of to a personal user account.

#### Pros

* Anyone with access to the repository and server has the ability to deploy the project.
* Users don't have to change their local SSH settings.
* Deploy keys can read and write by default, but can be made read-only.

#### Cons

* Deploy keys only grant access to a single repository. More complex projects may have many repositories to pull to the same server.
* Deploy keys are usually not protected by a passphrase, making the key easily accessible if the server is compromised.

#### Setup

1. [Run the `ssh-keygen` procedure][generating-ssh-keys] on your server.
2. In the top right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile photo.

3. On your profile page, click the **Repositories** tab, then click the name of your repository.

4. In your repository's right sidebar, click **Settings**.

3. In the sidebar, click **Deploy Keys**.

3. Click **Add deploy key**. Paste your public key in and submit.

## Machine users

If your server needs to access multiple repositories, you can choose to create a new GitHub account and attach an SSH key that will be used exclusively for automation.  Since this GitHub account won't be used by a human, it's called a machine user.  You can then [add the machine user as collaborator][collaborator] or [add the machine user to a team][team] with access to the repositories it needs to manipulate.  **NOTE**: Adding a machine user as a collaborator always grants read/write access.  Adding a machine user to a team grants the permissions of the team.

**Tip:** Our [terms of service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service) do mention that *'Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.'* and that *'One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.'*  But don't fear, we won't send rabid lawyers out to hunt you down if you create a single machine user for your organization's deploy scripts. Creating a single machine user for your project or organization is totally cool.

{{/tip}}

#### Pros

* Anyone with access to the repository and server has the ability to deploy the project.
* No (human) users need to change their local SSH settings.
* Multiple keys are not needed; one per server is adequate.

#### Cons

* Only organizations have access to create teams; therefore only organizations can use them to restrict machine users to read-only access.  Personal repositories always grant collaborators read/write access.
* Machine user keys, like deploy keys, are usually not protected by a passphrase.

#### Setup

1. [Run the `ssh-keygen` procedure][generating-ssh-keys] on your server and attach the public key to the machine user account.
2. Give that account access to the repositories it will need to access. You can do this by [adding the account as collaborator][collaborator] or [adding it to a team][team] in an organization.
