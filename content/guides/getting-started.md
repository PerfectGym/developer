# Getting Started

{:toc}

Let's walk through core API concepts as we tackle some everyday use cases.

## Overview

Most applications will use an existing [wrapper library][wrappers] in the language
of your choice, but it's important to familiarize yourself with the underlying API
HTTP methods first.

There's no easier way to kick the tires than through [cURL][curl].

### Hello World

Let's start by testing our setup. Open up a command prompt and enter the
following command:

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/zen

> Keep it logically awesome.
```

The response will be a random selection from our design philosophies.

Next, let's `GET` [Chris Wanstrath's][defunkt github] [GitHub profile][users api]:

``` command-line
# GET /users/defunkt
$ curl https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> {
>   "login": "defunkt",
>   "id": 2,
>   "url": "https://api.github.com/users/defunkt",
>   "html_url": "https://github.com/defunkt",
>   ...
> }
```

Mmmmm, tastes like [JSON][json]. Let's add the `-i` flag to include headers:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Server: GitHub.com
> Date: Sun, 11 Nov 2012 18:43:28 GMT
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> Connection: keep-alive
> Status: 200 OK
> ETag: "bfd85cbf23ac0b0c8a29bee02e7117c6"
> X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
> X-RateLimit-Remaining: 57
> X-RateLimit-Reset: 1352660008
> X-GitHub-Media-Type: github.v3
> Vary: Accept
> Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, s-maxage=60
> X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
> Content-Length: 692
> Last-Modified: Tue, 30 Oct 2012 18:58:42 GMT

> {
>   "login": "defunkt",
>   "id": 2,
>   "url": "https://api.github.com/users/defunkt",
>   "html_url": "https://github.com/defunkt",
>   ...
> }
```

There are a few interesting bits in the response headers. As expected, the
`Content-Type` is `application/json`.

Any headers beginning with `X-` are custom headers, and are not included in the
HTTP spec. Let's take a look at a few of them:

* `X-GitHub-Media-Type` has a value of `github.v3`. This lets us know the [media type][media types]
for the response. Media types have helped us version our output in API v3. We'll
talk more about that later.
* Take note of the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers. This
pair of headers indicate [how many requests a client can make][rate limiting] in
a rolling time period (typically an hour) and how many of those requests the
client has already spent.

## Authentication

Unauthenticated clients can make 60 requests per hour. To get more, we'll need to
_authenticate_. In fact, doing anything interesting with the GitHub API requires
[authentication][authentication].

### Basic

The easiest way to authenticate with the GitHub API is by simply using your GitHub
username and password via Basic Authentication.

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> Enter host password for user <em>your_username</em>:
```

The `-u` flag sets the username, and cURL will prompt you for the password. You
can use `-u "username:password"` to avoid the prompt, but this leaves your
password in shell history and isn't recommended. When authenticating, you
should see your rate limit bumped to 5,000 requests an hour, as indicated in the
`X-RateLimit-Limit` header.

In addition to just getting more calls per hour, authentication is the key to
reading and writing private information via the API.

### Two-factor authentication

If you have [two-factor authentication][2fa] enabled, the API will return a
`401 Unauthorized` error code for the above request (and every other API request):

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> Enter host password for user <em>your_username</em>:

> HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
> X-GitHub-OTP: required; :2fa-type

> {
>   "message": "Must specify two-factor authentication OTP code.",
>   "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#working-with-two-factor-authentication"
> }
```

The easiest way to get around that error is to create an OAuth token and use
OAuth authentication instead of Basic Authentication. See the
[OAuth section][oauth section] below for more information.

### Get your own user profile

When properly authenticated, you can take advantage of the permissions
associated with your GitHub account. For example, try getting
[your own user profile][auth user api]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> https://api.github.com/user

> {
>   ...
>   "plan": {
>     "space": 2516582,
>    "collaborators": 10,
>    "private_repos": 20,
>    "name": "medium"
>  }
>   ...
> }
```

This time, in addition to the same set of public information we
retrieved for [@defunkt][defunkt github] earlier, you should also see the non-public
information for your user profile. For example, you'll see a `plan` object
in the response which gives details about the GitHub plan for the account.

### OAuth

While convenient, Basic Authentication isn't ideal because you shouldn't give your GitHub
username and password to anyone. Applications that need to read or write
private information using the API on behalf of another user should use [OAuth][oauth].

Instead of usernames and passwords, OAuth uses _tokens_. Tokens provide two big
features:

* **Revokable access**: users can revoke authorization to third party apps at any time
* **Limited access**: users can review the specific access that a token
  will provide before authorizing a third party app

Normally, tokens are created via a [web flow][webflow]. An application
sends users to GitHub to log in. GitHub then presents a dialog
indicating the name of the app, as well as the level of access the app
has once it's authorized by the user. After a user authorizes access, GitHub
redirects the user back to the application:

![GitHub's OAuth Prompt](/assets/images/oauth_prompt.png)

However, you don't need to set up the entire web flow to begin working with OAuth tokens.
An easier way to get a token is to [create a **personal access token**][personal token] via your
[Personal access tokens settings page][tokens settings]:

![Personal Token selection](/assets/images/personal_token.png)

Also, the [**Authorizations API**][authorizations api] makes it simple to use Basic Authentication
to create an OAuth token. Try pasting and running the following command:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> -d '{"scopes": ["repo", "user"], "note": "getting-started"}' \
$    https://api.github.com/authorizations

> HTTP/1.1 201 Created
> Location: https://api.github.com/authorizations/2
> Content-Length: 384

> {
>   "scopes": [
>     "repo",
>    "user"
>  ],
>  "token": "5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4",
>  "updated_at": "2012-11-14T14:04:24Z",
>  "url": "https://api.github.com/authorizations/2",
>  "app": {
>    "url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#oauth-authorizations-api",
>    "name": "GitHub API"
>  },
>  "created_at": "2012-11-14T14:04:24Z",
>  "note_url": null,
>  "id": 2,
>   "note": "getting-started"
> }
```

There's a lot going on in this one little call, so let's break it down. First,
the `-d` flag indicates we're doing a `POST`, using the
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type (as opposed to `GET`). All `POST`
requests to the GitHub API should be in JSON.

Next, let's look at the `scopes` we're sending over in this call. When creating
a new token, we include an optional array of [_scopes_][scopes], or access
levels, that indicate what information this token can access. In this case,
we're setting up the token with _repo_ access, which grants access to read and
write to public and private repositories, and _user_ scope, which grants read
and write access to public and private user profile data. See
[the scopes docs][scopes] for a full list of
scopes. You should **only** request scopes that your application actually needs,
in order to not frighten users with potentially invasive actions. The `201`
status code tells us that the call was successful, and the JSON returned
contains the details of our new OAuth token.

If you have [two-factor authentication][2fa] enabled, the API will
return the [previously described `401 Unauthorized` error code][2fa section]
for the above request. You can get around that error by providing a 2FA OTP code
in the [X-GitHub-OTP request header][2fa header]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u <em>your_username</em> -H "X-GitHub-OTP: <em>your_2fa_OTP_code</em>" \
    -d '{"scopes": ["repo", "user"], "note": "getting-started"}' \
    https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

If you enabled 2FA with a mobile application, go ahead and get an OTP code from
your one-time password application on your phone. If you enabled 2FA with text
messages, you'll receive an SMS with your OTP code after making a request to
this endpoint.

Now, we can use the forty character `token` instead of a username and password
in the rest of our examples. Let's grab our own user info again, using OAuth this time:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
    https://api.github.com/user
```

**Treat OAuth tokens like passwords!** Don't share them with other users or store
them in insecure places. The tokens in these examples are fake and the names have
been changed to protect the innocent.

Now that we've got the hang of making authenticated calls, let's move along to
the [Repositories API][repos-api].

## Repositories

Almost any meaningful use of the GitHub API will involve some level of Repository
information. We can [`GET` repository details][get repo] in the same way we fetched user
details earlier:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap
```

In the same way, we can [view repositories for the authenticated user][user repos api]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
    https://api.github.com/user/repos
```

Or, we can [list repositories for another user][other user repos api]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie/repos
```

Or, we can [list repositories for an organization][org repos api]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/orgs/mozilla/repos
```

The information returned from these calls will depend on how we authenticate:

* Using Basic Authentication, the response includes all repositories the
  the user has access to see on github.com.
* Using OAuth, private repositories are only returned if the OAuth token
  contains the `repo` [scope][scopes].

As the [docs][repos-api] indicate, these methods take a `type` parameter that
can filter the repositories returned based on what type of access the user has
for the repository. In this way, we can fetch only directly-owned repositories,
organization repositories, or repositories the user collaborates on via a team.

``` command-line
$ curl -i "https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie/repos?type=owner"
```

In this example, we grab only those repositories that technoweenie owns, not the
ones on which he collaborates. Note the quoted URL above. Depending on your
shell setup, cURL sometimes requires a quoted URL or else it ignores the
query string.

### Create a repository

Fetching information for existing repositories is a common use case, but the
GitHub API supports creating new repositories as well. To [create a repository][create repo],
we need to `POST` some JSON containing the details and configuration options.

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
    -d '{ \
        "name": "blog", \
        "auto_init": true, \
        "private": true, \
        "gitignore_template": "nanoc" \
      }' \
    https://api.github.com/user/repos
```

In this minimal example, we create a new repository for our blog (to be served
on [GitHub Pages][pages], perhaps). Though the blog will be public, we've made
the repository private. In this single step, we'll also initialize it with
a README and a [nanoc][nanoc]-flavored [.gitignore template][gitignore
templates].

The resulting repository will be found at `https://github.com/<your_username>/blog`.
To create a repository under an organization for which you're
an owner, just change the API method from `/user/repos` to `/orgs/<org_name>/repos`.

Next, let's fetch our newly created repository:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/blog

> HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

> {
>    "message": "Not Found"
> }
```

Oh noes! Where did it go? Since we created the repository as _private_, we need
to authenticate in order to see it. If you're a grizzled HTTP user, you might
expect a `403` instead. Since we don't want to leak information about private
repositories, the GitHub API returns a `404` in this case, as if to say "we can
neither confirm nor deny the existence of this repository."

## Issues

The UI for Issues on GitHub aims to provide 'just enough' workflow while
staying out of your way. With the GitHub [Issues API][issues-api], you can pull
data out or create issues from other tools to create a workflow that works for
your team.

Just like github.com, the API provides a few methods to view issues for the
authenticated user. To [see all your issues][get issues api], call `GET /issues`:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
    https://api.github.com/issues
```

To get only the [issues under one of your GitHub organizations][get issues api], call `GET
/orgs/<org>/issues`:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
    https://api.github.com/orgs/rails/issues
```

We can also get [all the issues under a single repository][repo issues api]:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues
```

### Pagination

A project the size of Rails has thousands of issues. We'll need to [paginate][pagination],
making multiple API calls to get the data. Let's repeat that last call, this
time taking note of the response headers:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK

> ...
> Link: &lt;https://api.github.com/repositories/8514/issues?page=2&gt;; rel="next", &lt;https://api.github.com/repositories/8514/issues?page=30&gt;; rel="last"
> ...
```

The [`Link` header][link-header] provides a way for a response to link to
external resources, in this case additional pages of data. Since our call found
more than thirty issues (the default page size), the API tells us where we can
find the next page and the last page of results.

### Creating an issue

Now that we've seen how to paginate lists of issues, let's [create an issue][create issue] from
the API.

To create an issue, we need to be authenticated, so we'll pass an
OAuth token in the header. Also, we'll pass the title, body, and labels in the JSON
body to the `/issues` path underneath the repository in which we want to create
the issue:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'Authorization: token 5199831f4dd3b79e7c5b7e0ebe75d67aa66e79d4' \
$    -d '{ \
$         "title": "New logo", \
$         "body": "We should have one", \
$         "labels": ["design"] \
$       }' \
$    https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues

> HTTP/1.1 201 Created
> Location: https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17
> X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000

> {
>   "pull_request": {
>     "patch_url": null,
>     "html_url": null,
>     "diff_url": null
>   },
>   "created_at": "2012-11-14T15:25:33Z",
>   "comments": 0,
>   "milestone": null,
>   "title": "New logo",
>   "body": "We should have one",
>   "user": {
>     "login": "pengwynn",
>     "gravatar_id": "7e19cd5486b5d6dc1ef90e671ba52ae0",
>     "avatar_url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e19cd5486b5d6dc1ef90e671ba52ae0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png",
>     "id": 865,
>     "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pengwynn"
>   },
>   "closed_at": null,
>   "updated_at": "2012-11-14T15:25:33Z",
>   "number": 17,
>   "closed_by": null,
>   "html_url": "https://github.com/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17",
>   "labels": [
>     {
>       "color": "ededed",
>       "name": "design",
>       "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/labels/design"
>     }
>   ],
>   "id": 8356941,
>   "assignee": null,
>   "state": "open",
>   "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/api-sandbox/issues/17"
> }
```

The response gives us a couple of pointers to the newly created issue, both in
the `Location` response header and the `url` field of the JSON response.

## Conditional requests

A big part of being a good API citizen is respecting rate limits by
caching information that hasn't changed. The API supports [conditional
requests][conditional-requests] and helps you do the right thing. Consider the
first call we made to get defunkt's profile:

``` command-line
$ curl -i https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> ETag: "bfd85cbf23ac0b0c8a29bee02e7117c6"
```

In addition to the JSON body, take note of the HTTP status code of `200` and
the `ETag` header.
The [ETag][etag] is a fingerprint of the response. If we pass that on subsequent calls,
we can tell the API to give us the resource again, only if it has changed:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "bfd85cbf23ac0b0c8a29bee02e7117c6"' \
$    https://api.github.com/users/defunkt

> HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
```

The `304` status indicates that the resource hasn't changed since the last time
we asked for it and the response will contain no body. As a bonus, `304`
responses don't count against your [rate limit][rate-limiting].

Woot! Now you know the basics of the GitHub API!

* Basic & OAuth authentication
* Fetching and creating repositories and issues
* Conditional requests
