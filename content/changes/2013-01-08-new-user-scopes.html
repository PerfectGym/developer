We've added a [few new user scopes][scopes] for 3rd party applications that want very
specific user functionality.  The `user:email` scope gives apps read-only access
to a user's private email addresses.  The `user:follow` scope lets a user
follow and unfollow other users.

This should help keep applications from requiring the `user` scope, which
can be potentially dangerous.

We also added a read-only endpoint to get a user's public SSH keys.

    GET https://api.github.com/users/technoweenie/keys
