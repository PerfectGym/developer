We've made it even easier to list all [issues][] and [pull requests][] via the API.
The `state` parameter now supports a value of `all` that will return issues and
pull requests regardless of state.

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/atom/vim-mode/issues\?state\=all
```

We've also introduced new sorting options for [listing pull requests][pull
requests]. You can now sort pull requests by `created`, `updated`,
`popularity`, and `long-running`.

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/pulls\?sort\=long-running\&direction\=desc
```

Happy querying. If you have any questions or feedback [get in touch][contact].
