We've added a [new API method](/v3/orgs#list-all-organizations) to list all organizations:

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/organizations

> [
>   {
>     "login": "github",
>     "id": 9919,
>     "url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/github",
>    "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/github/repos",
>    "events_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/github/events",
>    "members_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/github/members{/member}",
>    "public_members_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/github/public_members{/member}",
>    "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=3",
>     "description": "GitHub, the company."
>   },
>   ...
> ]
```
