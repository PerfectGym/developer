You can now see when a user starred a repository. To receive the new response format containing the `starred_at` field, request the new media type:

``` command-line
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.star+json" https://api.github.com/users/andrew/starred
```

Note the starred repository is now available in the repo field.
