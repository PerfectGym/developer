You've always been able to grab all the commit comments for an entire
repository via the API, but to get Issue comments and Pull Request Review
Comments, you could only fetch the comments for a single Issue or Pull Request.

Today, we're introducing two new methods to grab all Issue Comments and Review
Comments for a repository.

``` command-line
# Grab all Issue Comments
> curl https://api.github.com/repos/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/issues/comments

# Grab all Review Comments
> curl https://api.github.com/repos/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/pulls/comments
```

Check out the docs for sorting and filtering options:

* [Issue comments](/v3/issues/comments/#list-comments-in-a-repository)
* [Review comments](/v3/pulls/comments/#list-comments-in-a-repository)
