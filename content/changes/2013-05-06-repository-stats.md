Today we're happy to open our [Repository Statistics API](/v3/repos/statistics) to everyone.  We're using
repository statistics to power [our graphs](https://github.com/github/linguist/graphs),
but we can't wait to see what others can do with this information.

Starting today, these resources are available to you:

* **[Contributors](/v3/repos/statistics/#contributors)**
* **[Commit Activity](/v3/repos/statistics/#commit-activity)**
* **[Code Frequency](/v3/repos/statistics/#code-frequency)**
* **[Participation](/v3/repos/statistics/#participation)**
* **[Punch Card](/v3/repos/statistics/#punch-card)**

Enjoy!
