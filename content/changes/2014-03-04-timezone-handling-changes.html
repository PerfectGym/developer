We have improved support for handling timezones in our API. For example, if you
create commits through the API, we now allow for specifying timezone information
more accurately.

We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone
information for API calls:

#### Explicitly provide an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information

For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact
timestamp. An example of this is the [Commits API](/v3/git/commits) which allows
for specifying the `date` property.

<%= json "message"=> "my commit message", \
    "author"=> \
    {"name" => "Dirkjan Bussink", "email" => "d.bussink@gmail.com", \
    "date" => "2014-02-27T15:05:06+01:00"}, \
    "parents"=>["7d1b31e74ee336d15cbd21741bc88a537ed063a0"], \
    "tree"=>"827efc6d56897b048c772eb4087f854f46256132" %>

#### Using the `Time-Zone` header

It is possible to supply a `Time-Zone` header which defines a timezone according
to the [list of names from the Olson database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

``` command-line
$ curl -H "Time-Zone: Europe/Amsterdam" -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/contents/new_file.md
```

This means that we generate a timestamp for the moment your API call is made in
the timezone this header defines. For example, the [Contents API](/v3/repos/contents/)
generates a git commit for each addition or change and uses the current time
as the timestamp. This header will determine the timezone used for generating
that current timestamp.

#### Using the last known timezone for the user

If no `Time-Zone` header is specified and you make an authenticated call to the
API, we use the last known timezone for the authenticated user. The last know
timezone is updated whenever you browse the GitHub.com website.

#### UTC

If the steps above don't result in any information, we use UTC as the timezone
to create the git commit.
