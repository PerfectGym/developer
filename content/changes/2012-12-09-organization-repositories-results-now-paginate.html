Improvements continue to the Organizations Repository listing endpoint.
Today we're improving pagination so that it works as documented.  Now
you can expect `Link` headers to navigate through the results space,
regardless of what you send in the `type` parameter.

The docs for Organization Repositories queries are still here:

* [Organization Repositories](/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories)

**EDIT:** `Link` headers are our preferred navigation technique.
