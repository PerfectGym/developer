Today we're shipping two improvements to the [new Search API][original-search-api-announcement].

## More Text Match Metadata

When searching for code, the API previously provided [text match metadata][text-matches] (i.e., "highlights") for file content.
Now, you can also [get this metadata][code-text-matches] for matches that occur within the file path.

For example, when [searching for files that have "client" in their path][example-path-search], the results include this match for `lib/octokit/client/commits.rb`:

{:.json}
    {
      "name": "commits.rb",
      "path": "lib/octokit/client/commits.rb",
      "text_matches": [
        {
          "object_url": "https://api.github.com/repositories/417862/contents/lib/octokit/client/commits.rb?ref=8d487ab06ccef463aa9f5412a56f1a2f1fa4dc88",
          "object_type": "FileContent",
          "property": "path",
          "fragment": "lib/octokit/client/commits.rb",
          "matches": [
            {
              "text": "client",
              "indices": [ 12, 18 ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
      // ...
    }

## Better Text Match Metadata

Before today, the API applied HTML entity encoding to all `fragment` data.
For example, imagine your search returns an issue like <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/11889" data-proofer-ignore>rails/rails#11889</a>:

![Example Issue Title](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2988/994632/a84f2888-09af-11e3-9417-4bd92f1f1ed6.png)

The response would include a `text_matches` array with the following object:

{:.json}
    {
      "fragment": "undefined method 'except' for #&lt;Array:XXX&gt;",
      // ...
    }

Inside the `fragment` value, we see HTML-encoded entities (e.g., `&lt;`).
Since we're returning JSON (not HTML), API clients might not expect any HTML-encoded text.
As of today, the API returns these fragments _without_ this extraneous encoding.

{:.json}
    {
      "fragment": "undefined method 'except' for #<Array:XXX>",
      // ...
    }
