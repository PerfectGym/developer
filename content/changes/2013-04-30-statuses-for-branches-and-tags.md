Last week we announced [support for build statuses in the branches page][blog].
Now we are extending this to the API. The [API endpoint for commit statuses][doc]
has been extended to allow branch and tag names, as well as commit SHAs.

``` command-line
curl https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/statuses/3-2-stable
```

Enjoy.
