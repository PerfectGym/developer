With the release of our [new webhook UI](https://github.com/blog/1778-webhooks-level-up), we included a new
[ping event](/webhooks/#ping-event) that webhooks will receive. When you
create a new webhook, we will send this event as an initial test of the webhook.

The ping is only informational, doesn't need to be responded to in a specific way,
and nothing bad will happen if you respond with an error. It's just a quick
"hello world" to let you know you set everything up correctly.

We also added a [ping endpoint](/v3/repos/hooks/#ping-a-hook) to the hooks API.
By using ping instead of [test](/v3/repos/hooks/#test-a-push-hook), you can ensure
you won't be limited by the `push` event requirement that the test endpoint has.
