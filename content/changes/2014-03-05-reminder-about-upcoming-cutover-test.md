In January, we announced an [upcoming change to the default media type][2014-01-announcement]. To help developers assess the impact of that change before it becomes permanent, we're performing a [24-hour cutover test next week][cutover-test-announcement].

From approximately 12:01am UTC to 11:59pm UTC on March 12, the API will [respond with the v3 media type by default][what's-changing]. (See the [start time for the cutover test in your time zone][start-time].)

Follow [@GitHubAPI][] to receive updates before and after the test.

Please see the [original announcement][2014-01-announcement] for full details. If you have any questions, please [get in touch][contact].
