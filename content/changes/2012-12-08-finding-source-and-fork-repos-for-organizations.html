We've made a couple of changes today to the Organization repositories
listing to bring it a bit closer to the functionality of the GitHub.com
Organization repositories tab.  We now let you retrieve repositories
which are forks of another repository, as well as those repositories which
are sources (not forks).

``` command-line
# Grab all fork Repositories for an Organization
$ curl "https://api.github.com/orgs/:org/repos?type=forks"

# Grab all source Repositories for an Organization
$ curl "https://api.github.com/orgs/:org/repos?type=sources"
```

Check out the docs for sorting and filtering options:

* [Organization Repositories](/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories)
