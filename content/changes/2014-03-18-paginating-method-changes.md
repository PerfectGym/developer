In an effort to keep the API fast for everyone, we're enabling
[pagination][paginating] on some API methods that previously did not support it.
Beginning today, the methods below will paginate if you include `page` or
`per_page` query parameters. Starting April 17th, 2014, these methods will
_always_ return [paginated results][paginating]. If you have any questions or
run into trouble, feel free to [get in touch][contact].

Here's the complete list of updated methods:
