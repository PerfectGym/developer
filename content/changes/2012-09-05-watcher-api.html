title: Upcoming Changes to Watcher and Star APIs

We recently [changed the Watcher behavior][change-watching] on GitHub.  What
used to be known as "Watching" is now "Starring".  Starring is basically a way
to bookmark interesting repositories.  Watching is a way to indicate that you
want to receive email or web notifications on a Repository.

This works well on GitHub.com, but poses a problem for the GitHub API.  How do
we change this in a way that developers can gracefully upgrade their
applications?  We're currently looking at rolling out the changes in three
phases over an extended period of time.

## Current Status

The current [Repository Starring][starring-api] methods look like this:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/watchers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/watched` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/watched` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

[starring-api]: /v3/activity/starring/

## Phase 1: Add Watchers as Subscriptions

This phase exposes Watchers as "Subscriptions".  This is to
keep from clashing with the legacy endpoints.  This phase will happen
automatically <s>and will not break your application until Phase 3 starts</s>.
(**UPDATE**: API v3 will continue to support this functionality indefinitely.)

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers` - A list of users watching the repository.
* `/users/:user/subscriptions` - A list of repositories that a user is watching.
* `/user/subscriptions` - A list of repositories the current user is watching.

We'll also add a copy of the legacy Watchers API in the new endpoint:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/stargazers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/starred` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/starred` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

This is in place _now_ with the current media type for the API:

    application/vnd.github.beta+json

If you care about your application not breaking, make sure all outgoing API
requests pass that value for the "Accept" header.  You should do this now.  This
can be verified by checking the `X-GitHub-Media-Type` header on all API
responses.

``` command-line
# Accesses a user's starred repositories.
$ curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
$  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta+json"
```

-<s>This Phase will be broken once Phase 3 starts.  Phase 3 removes all support for
the "beta" media type, and makes the "v3" media type the implicit default
for API requests.</s>

## UPDATE - November 6, 2013

<div class="alert">
  <p>
    API v3 will continue to officially support the functionality described in
    Phase 1 above. This functionality will remain intact for the lifetime of
    API v3.
  </p>
  <p>
    API v3 will <em>not</em> include Phases 2 and 3 (below). Those phases will
    likely be part of the next major version of the API. (We have not announced
    a timeline for the next major version of the API.)
  </p>
</div>

## <s>Phase 2: Switch <code>/watchers</code> API Endpoint</s>

<s>The "watch" endpoints will now be a copy of the "subscription" endpoints.  You
will have to use <code>/user/starred</code> to get a user's starred repositories, not
<code>/user/watched</code>.</s>

<s>This requires a new media type value:</s>

<s><pre>application/vnd.github.v3+json</pre></s>

<s>This is a breaking change from Phase 1.  We will release this change in an
experimental mode first, letting developers gracefully upgrade their
applications by specifying the new media value for the Accept header.</s>

<s>
<pre>
# Accesses a user's watched repositories.
curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
</pre>
</s>

## <s>Phase 3: Remove <code>/subscribers</code> API Endpoint.</s>

<s>This phase involves disabling the subscription endpoints completely.  At this
point, you should be using the starring endpoints for starred repositories, and
the watch endpoints for watched repositories.  No date has been set yet, but we
expect this to be <em>3-6 months</em> after Phase 2 is in place.  This should give
developers enough time for a smooth upgrade path.  If they use popular API
wrappers, the work will likely mostly be done for them.</s>

<s>Keep on passing the "v3" media type in your application, until the API has
another breaking change to make.  If you can't make the deadline for Phase 3,
just set the "beta" media type until we shut that down completely.  It's likely
that we will keep the old "beta" media type active for another month, like
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1090-github-api-moving-on">last time</a> we terminated
old API functionality.</s>
