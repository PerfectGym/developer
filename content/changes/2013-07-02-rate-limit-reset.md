Have you ever wondered when your [rate limit][rate-limit-docs] will reset back to its maximum value?
That information is now available in the new `X-RateLimit-Reset` response header.

``` command-line
$ curl -I https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Status: 200 OK
> X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
> X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
> X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
> ...
```

The `X-RateLimit-Reset` header provides a [Unix UTC timestamp][unix-time], letting you know the exact time that your fresh new rate limit kicks in.

The reset timestamp is also available as part of the `/rate_limit` resource.

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/rate_limit

> {
>   "rate": {
>     "limit": 60,
>     "remaining": 42,
>     "reset": 1372700873
>   }
> }
```

For more information on rate limits, be sure to check out the [docs][rate-limit-docs].
