The [Authorizations API][oauth-api] is an easy way to create an OAuth
authorization using Basic Auth. Just POST your desired scopes and optional
note and you get a token back:

``` command-line
$ curl -u pengwynn -d '{"scopes": ["user", "gist"]}' \
$      https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

This call creates a token for the authenticated user tied to a special "API"
OAuth application.

We now support creating tokens for _your own OAuth application_ by passing your
twenty character `client_id` and forty character `client_secret` as found in
the settings page for your OAuth application.


``` command-line
$ curl -u pengwynn -d '{ \
$                      "scopes": ["user", "gist"], \
$                      "client_id": "abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde" \
$                      "client_secret": "abcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcdeabcde" \
$                     }' \ '
$        https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

No more implementing the [web flow][web-flow] just to get a token tied to your
app's rate limit.
