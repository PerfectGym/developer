Today, weâ€™ve added example [webhook][webhooks] payloads to the [event types][event-types] page.
Alongside existing descriptions for each event, we now include an [example payload][full-payload]
so that you can quickly see the data provided by the event. You can learn more about how webhooks
work with our [Webhooks Guide][webhooks-guide].

If you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch][get-in-touch].
