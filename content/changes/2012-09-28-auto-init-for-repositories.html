title: Initialize a repository when creating

Today we've made it easier to add commits to a repository via the GitHub API.
Until now, you could [create a repository](/v3/repos/#create), but you would
need to initialize it locally via your Git client before adding any commits via
the API.

Now you can optionally init a repository when it's created by sending `true`
for the `auto_init` parameter:

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u pengwynn \
$      -d '{"name": "create-repo-test", "auto_init": true}' \
$      https://api.github.com/user/repos
```

The resulting repository will have a README stub and an initial commit.

### .gitignore templates

Along with this change, you can set up your `.gitignore` template by passing
the basename of any template in the [GitHub gitignore templates
project](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

``` command-line
$ curl -i -u pengwynn \
$      -d '{"name": "create-repo-test", "auto_init": true, \
$           "gitignore_template": "Haskell"}' \
$      https://api.github.com/user/repos
```

As the [docs point out](/v3/repos/#create), the `gitignore_template` parameter
is ignored if `auto_init` is not present and `true`.
