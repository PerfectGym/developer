We just added a [new API method](/v3/orgs/teams/#list-user-teams) to list all
the teams for the authenticated user across all organizations:

``` command-line
$ curl -H "Authorization: token [yours]" https://api.github.com/user/teams

> [
>   {
>     "name": "Testing",
>     "id": 396018,
>     "slug": "testing",
>    "permission": "pull",
>    "url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018",
>    "members_url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018/members{/member}",
>    "repositories_url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018/repos",
>    "members_count": 1,
>    "repos_count": 0,
