The [Meta API](/v3/meta/) now includes the A record IP addresses for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

``` command-line
$ curl https://api.github.com/meta
```

``` json
{
  "verifiable_password_authentication": true,
  "github_services_sha": "23c6105183b626cf74c045f6d53af7a178bfdb4c",
  "hooks": [
    "192.30.252.0/22"
  ],
  "git": [
    "192.30.252.0/22"
  ],
  "pages": [
    "192.30.252.153/32",
    "192.30.252.154/32"
  ]
}
```

These IP addresses are used to [configure A records with your DNS provider for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/). These addresses have changed a few times in the past. This API always provides the current addresses so that you can automate the process of keeping your DNS records up to date.
