We turned Hookshot (our new GitHub Services backend) on yesterday.  Things have
been pretty smooth, with one issue:  Hooks going to other EC2 nodes come from
the private IP addresses of our nodes in the 10.*.*.* range.

If your web hook servers are on EC2 and are missing hooks from GitHub due to
an IP restriction, we recommend the following:

1. Remove the IP white list.
2. Fall back to HTTPS and Basic Auth to restrict pushes to authorized senders only.

We're currently working on solving this problem.  Hit up [support@github.com](mailto:support@github.com)
if you have any questions.
