The preview period for the new [Deployments API][2014-01-deployments-api-post] continues to yield valuable feedback from developers. In early March, we used that feedback to [improve the payload format][payload-update] that integrations can use to customize deployments. A few weeks later, we began integrating with the new [Combined Status API][combined-statuses] to help ensure that only verified code gets deployed, even if you have multiple systems verifying different aspects of your software.

To give developers time to explore these recent refinements to the Deployments API, we're extending the preview period for a little while longer. As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please [get in touch][contact].
