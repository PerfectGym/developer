Is your application taking advantage of the recommended workflow for discovering a user's repositories and organizations? With the [recent improvements to the API](/changes/2014-12-08-organization-permissions-api-preview/), the process is simpler than ever. In our newest guide, we show you how to [reliably identify the resources that your app can access for a given user](/guides/discovering-resources-for-a-user/).

If you have any questions or feedback, we'd love to [hear from you][contact].
