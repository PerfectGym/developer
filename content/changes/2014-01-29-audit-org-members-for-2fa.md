We've added a [new filter][filter] for listing members of an organization without
[two-factor authentication][2fa-blog] enabled:


``` command-line
$ curl -H "Authorization: token [yours]" \
       "https://api.github.com/orgs/[orgname]/members?filter=2fa_disabled"
```

The new filter is available for owners of organizations with private
repositories. Happy auditing and [send us your feedback or questions][contact].
