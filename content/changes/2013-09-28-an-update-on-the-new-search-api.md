We owe a big "Thank You!" to everyone that has taken the time to try out the [new Search API][original-blog-post].
We `:heart:` every one of you.
Just as we hoped,
the [preview period][] has allowed us to see how you want to use the new API,
and it has given us a chance to improve the API before finalizing it.

In order to incorporate everything that we've learned,
we're going to keep the Search API in [preview mode][preview period] for a little while longer.
We have a few bugs to squash and a couple performance kinks to iron out.
We're hard at work on those improvements now,
and we expect to have more news in the coming weeks.

In the mean time, [keep the suggestions coming][contact]!
