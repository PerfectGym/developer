# Overview

As one of our integrators, we're excited to tell the world about your GitHub integration at [https://github.com/integrations](https://github.com/integrations). To ensure the GitHub community has the best experience finding and using your integrations, we've outlined a [short list of requirements](/integrations-directory/getting-listed/) to follow.

We're happy to chat about these if you have any questions. Feel free to reach out to [partnerships@github.com](mailto:partnerships@github.com) for additional detail.
