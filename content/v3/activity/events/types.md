# Event Types & Payloads

Each event has a similar JSON schema, but a unique `payload` object that is
determined by its event type.

Event names are used by [repository webhooks](/v3/repos/hooks/) to specify
which events the webhook should receive. The included payloads below are from webhook deliveries but
match events returned by the [Events API](/v3/activity/events/) (except where noted). The Events API uses the CamelCased name (e.g. `CommitCommentEvent`) in the `type` field of an event object and does not include the `repository` or `sender` fields in the event payload object.


**Note:** Some of these events may not be rendered in timelines, they're only
created for various internal and webhook purposes.
