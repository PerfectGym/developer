{{#warning}}

If your GitHub Enterprise appliance has [LDAP Sync with Active Directory LDAP servers](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.1/admin/guides/user-management/using-ldap), this API is disabled and will return a `403` response. Users managed by an external account cannot be suspended via the API.

{{/warning}}

    PUT /users/:username/suspended

You can suspend any user account except your own.

<%= fetch_content(:put_content_length) %>

### Response

<%= headers 204 %>

## Unsuspend a user

{{#warning}}

If your GitHub Enterprise appliance has [LDAP Sync with Active Directory LDAP servers](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.1/admin/guides/user-management/using-ldap), this API is disabled and will return a `403` response. Users managed by an external account cannot be unsuspended via the API.

} %>
