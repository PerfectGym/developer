--------|---------|--------------
`repositories` | `array` of `strings` | **Required**. A list of arrays indicating which repositories should be migrated.
`lock_repositories`|`boolean` | Indicates whether repositories should be locked (to prevent manipulation) while migrating data. Default: `false`.

### Response

The `state` of a migration can be one of the following values:

* `pending`, which means the migration hasn't started yet.
* `exporting`, which means the migration is in progress.
* `exported`, which means the migration finished successfully.
* `failed`, which means the migration failed.

<%= headers 200 %>
