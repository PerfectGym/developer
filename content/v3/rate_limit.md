# Rate Limit

The overview documentation describes the [rate limit rules](/v3/#rate-limiting).
You can check your current rate limit status at any time using the Rate Limit
API described below.

## Get your current rate limit status

Note: Accessing this endpoint does not count against your rate limit.

    GET /rate_limit

#### Understanding Your Rate Limit Status

The Search API has a [custom rate limit](/v3/search/#rate-limit), separate from
the rate limit governing the rest of the API. For that reason, the response
(shown above) categorizes your rate limit by resource. Within the `"resources"`
object, the `"search"` object provides your rate limit status for the
[Search API](/v3/search). The `"core"` object provides your rate limit status for
all the _rest_ of the API.

#### Deprecation Notice

The `"rate"` object (shown at the bottom of the response above) is
[deprecated](/v3/versions/#v3-deprecations) and is scheduled for removal in the next
version of the API.

If you're writing new API client code (or updating your existing code), you
should use the `"core"` object instead of the `"rate"` object. The `"core"` object
contains the same information that is present in the `"rate"` object.
