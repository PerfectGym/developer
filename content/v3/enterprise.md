# Enterprise <%= config[:versions][0] %>

{:toc}

[GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) supports the same powerful API available on GitHub.com as well as its own set of API endpoints. You can find a list of these endpoints on the sidebar, with the exception of the [User Administration][] API, which is within its own section.

## Endpoint URLs

All API endpoints—except [Management Console][] API endpoints—are prefixed with the following URL:

``` command-line
http(s)://<em>hostname</em>/api/v3/
```

[Management Console][] API endpoints are only prefixed with a hostname:

``` command-line
http(s)://<em>hostname</em>/
```

## Authentication

Your Enterprise installation's API endpoints accept [the same authentication methods](http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) as the GitHub.com API. Specifically, you can authenticate yourself with **[OAuth tokens][]** (which can be created using the [Authorizations API][]) or **[basic authentication][]**.

Every Enterprise API endpoint is only accessible to GitHub Enterprise site administrators, with the exception of the [Management Console][] API, which is only accessible via the [Management Console password][].

[Authorizations API]: /v3/oauth_authorizations/#create-a-new-authorization
[OAuth tokens]: /v3/oauth/
[basic authentication]: /v3/#basic-authentication
[Management Console]: /v3/enterprise/management_console/
[User Administration]: /v3/users/administration/
[Management Console password]: https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.0/admin/articles/accessing-the-management-console/
