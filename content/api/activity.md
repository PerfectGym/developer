# Activity

Serving up the 'social' in Social Coding, the Activity APIs provide access to
notifications, subscriptions, and timelines.

## [Events][]

The [Events API][Events] is a read-only interface to all the [event
types][types] that power the various activity streams on GitHub.

## [Feeds][]

List of [Atom feeds][Feeds] available for the authenticated user.

## [Notifications][]

Notifications of new comments are delivered to users.  [The Notifications
API][Notifications] lets you view these notifications and mark them as read.

## [Starring][]

[Repository Starring][Starring] is a feature that lets users bookmark repositories.  Stars
are shown next to repositories to show an approximate level of interest.  Stars
have no effect on notifications or the activity feed.

## [Watching][]

[Watching a Repository][Watching] registers the user to receive notifications on new
discussions, as well as events in the user's activity feed.
