# OAuth Authorizations API

{:toc}

You can use this API to manage your OAuth applications. You can only access this API via [Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication) using your username and password, not tokens.

Make sure you understand how to [work with two-factor authentication](/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication) if you or your users have two-factor authentication enabled.

<div class="alert">
  <h3 id="deprecation-notice">Deprecation Notice</h3>

  <p>
    The <code>token</code> attribute is <a href="/v3/versions/#v3-deprecations">deprecated</a> in all
    of the following OAuth Authorizations API responses:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#list-your-authorizations">List your authorizations</a></li>
    <li><a href="#get-a-single-authorization">Get a single authorization</a></li>
    <li><a href="#get-or-create-an-authorization-for-a-specific-app">Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app</a> - <code>token</code> is still returned for "create" </li>
    <li><a href="#get-or-create-an-authorization-for-a-specific-app-and-fingerprint">Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app and fingerprint</a> - <code>token</code> is still returned for "create" </li>
    <li><a href="#update-an-existing-authorization">Update an existing authorization</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To reduce the impact of removing the <code>token</code> value,
    the OAuth Authorizations API now includes a new request attribute
    (<code>fingerprint</code>), three new response attributes
    (<code>token_last_eight</code>, <code>hashed_token</code>, and
    <code>fingerprint</code>), and
    <a href="#get-or-create-an-authorization-for-a-specific-app-and-fingerprint">one new endpoint</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This functionality became the default for all requests on April 20, 2015. Please see <a href="/changes/2015-04-20-authorizations-api-response-changes-are-now-in-effect/">the blog post</a> for full details.

## List your authorizations

    GET /authorizations

### Response

<%= headers 200, :pagination => default_pagination_rels %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| [h.merge("token" => "")] } %>

## Get a single authorization

    GET /authorizations/:id

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("token" => "") } %>

## Create a new authorization

If you need a small number of tokens, implementing the [web flow](/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow)
can be cumbersome. Instead, tokens can be created using the OAuth Authorizations API using
[Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication). To create tokens for a particular OAuth application, you
must provide its client ID and secret, found on the OAuth application settings
page, linked from your [OAuth applications listing on GitHub][app-listing]. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user you should use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them. OAuth tokens
can also be created through the web UI via the [Personal access tokens settings][tokens-listing].
Read more about these tokens on the [GitHub Help page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).

    POST /authorizations

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`scopes`|`array` | A list of scopes that this authorization is in.
`note`|`string` | **Required**. A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for. Tokens not associated with a specific OAuth application (i.e. personal access tokens) must have a unique note.
`note_url`|`string` | A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.
`client_id`|`string` | The 20 character OAuth app client key for which to create the token.
`client_secret`|`string` | The 40 character OAuth app client secret for which to create the token.
`fingerprint`|`string` | A unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user.


<%= json :scopes => ["public_repo"], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response

<%= headers 201, :Location => get_resource(:oauth_access)['url'] %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("fingerprint" => "") } %>

## Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app

This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application,
only if an authorization for that application doesn't already exist for the
user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is
requesting the token. It returns the user's existing authorization for the
application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.

    PUT /authorizations/clients/:client_id

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`client_secret`|`string`| **Required**. The 40 character OAuth app client secret associated with the client ID specified in the URL.
`scopes`|`array` | A list of scopes that this authorization is in.
`note`|`string` | A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for.
`note_url`|`string` | A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.
`fingerprint`|`string` | A unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client and user. If provided, this API is functionally equivalent to [Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app and fingerprint](/v3/oauth_authorizations/#get-or-create-an-authorization-for-a-specific-app-and-fingerprint).


<%= json :client_secret => "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd", :scopes => ["public_repo"], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response if returning a new token

<%= headers 201, :Location => get_resource(:oauth_access)['url'] %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("fingerprint" => "") } %>

### Response if returning an existing token

<%= headers 200, :Location => get_resource(:oauth_access)['url'] %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("token" => "", "fingerprint" => "") } %>

## Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app and fingerprint

This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application,
only if an authorization for that application and fingerprint do not already
exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth
app that is requesting the token. `fingerprint` is a unique string to
distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and
user. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one
is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.

    PUT /authorizations/clients/:client_id/:fingerprint

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`client_secret`|`string`| **Required**. The 40 character OAuth app client secret associated with the client ID specified in the URL.
`scopes`|`array` | A list of scopes that this authorization is in.
`note`|`string` | A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for.
`note_url`|`string` | A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.


<%= json :client_secret => "abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd", :scopes => ["public_repo"], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response if returning a new token

<%= headers 201, :Location => get_resource(:oauth_access)['url'] %>
<%= json :oauth_access %>

### Response if returning an existing token

<%= headers 200, :Location => get_resource(:oauth_access)['url'] %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("token" => "") } %>

## Update an existing authorization

    PATCH /authorizations/:id

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`scopes`|`array` | Replaces the authorization scopes with these.
`add_scopes`|`array` | A list of scopes to add to this authorization.
`remove_scopes`|`array` | A list of scopes to remove from this authorization.
`note`|`string` | A note to remind you what the OAuth token is for. Tokens not associated with a specific OAuth application (i.e. personal access tokens) must have a unique note.
`note_url`|`string` | A URL to remind you what app the OAuth token is for.
`fingerprint`|`string` | A unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user.


You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.

<%= json :add_scopes => ['repo'], :note => 'admin script' %>

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:oauth_access) { |h| h.merge("token" => "") } %>

## Delete an authorization

    DELETE /authorizations/:id

### Response

<%= headers 204 %>

## Check an authorization

OAuth applications can use a special API method for checking OAuth token
validity without running afoul of normal rate limits for failed login attempts.
Authentication works differently with this particular endpoint. You must use
[Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication) when accessing it, where the username is the OAuth
application `client_id` and the password is its `client_secret`. Invalid tokens
will return `404 NOT FOUND`.

    GET /applications/:client_id/tokens/:access_token

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:oauth_access_with_user) %>

## Reset an authorization

OAuth applications can use this API method to reset a valid OAuth token without
end user involvement.  Applications must save the "token" property in the
response, because changes take effect immediately. You must use
[Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication) when accessing it, where
the username is the OAuth application `client_id` and the password is its
`client_secret`. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.

    POST /applications/:client_id/tokens/:access_token

### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json(:oauth_access_with_user) %>

## Revoke all authorizations for an application

OAuth application owners can revoke every token for an OAuth application. You
must use [Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication) when calling
this method. The username is the OAuth application `client_id` and the password
is its `client_secret`. Tokens are revoked via a background job, and it might
take a few minutes for the process to complete.

    DELETE /applications/:client_id/tokens

### Response

<%= headers 204 %>

## Revoke an authorization for an application

OAuth application owners can also revoke a single token for an OAuth
application. You must use [Basic Authentication](/v3/auth#basic-authentication)
for this method, where the username is the OAuth application `client_id` and
  the password is its `client_secret`.

    DELETE /applications/:client_id/tokens/:access_token

### Response

<%= headers 204 %>
