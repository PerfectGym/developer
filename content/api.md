## Endpoint names and return values

An endpoint's name indicates the type of data it handles and the action it performs on that data. 
The most common actions are:

Action   | HTTP Method  | Description
---------|--------------|-----------
List     |`GET`  		| Returns _summary_ information for all entities that match query parameters you provide. To get _detailed_ information for a particular entity, first get the entity's id with the appropriate List endpoint, then provide the id to the corresponding Retrieve endpoint.
Retrive  |`GET`  		| Provides _detailed_ information for the single entity that matches the identifier you provide.
Execute	 |`POST`   		| Used for invoking actions.
Add	 	 |`POST`   		| Used for creating resources.
Update 	 |`POST`   		| Used for updating resources.
